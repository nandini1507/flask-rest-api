# flask-rest-api
This project is a simple REST API built with the Flask framework in Python. It demonstrates the fundamentals of API development by implementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for user data. The application uses in‑memory storage (a dictionary) to manage users and exposes endpoints that return JSON responses.
